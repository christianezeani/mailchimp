Mailchimp PHP wrapper provides a model based implementation for MailChimp API.

## Installation

Package available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/christianezeani/mailchimp), and can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

If you're using Composer to manage dependencies, you can use

```sh
composer require christianezeani/mailchimp
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of MailChimp PHP Wrapper.

Alternatively, if you're not using Composer, load `/path/to/mailchimp/autoload.php` file manually:

```php
<?php
require_once('/path/to/mailchimp/autoload.php');
```

## A Simple Example

```php
<?php
use MailChimp\Config;
use MailChimp\MailChimp;
use MailChimp\Models\Lists\Audience;

$config = new Config('_your_api_key_');
$mailChimp = new MailChimp($config);

$audience = $mailChimp->model(Audience::class);
$audience = $audience->create([
  'name' => 'MailChimp Test ',
  'contact' => [
    'company' => 'Demo Company Inc.',
    'address1' => 'Just a demo address',
    'city' => 'Nnewi South',
    'state' => 'Anambra',
    'zip' => '23401',
    'country' => 'Nigeria',
    'phone' => '+2347000000000'
  ],
  'permission_reminder' => 'Demo permission reminder',
  'campaign_defaults' => [
    'from_name' => 'Christian Ezeani',
    'from_email' => 'christian@example.com',
    'subject' => 'Demo Subject',
    'language' => 'en'
  ],
  'email_type_option' => false,
  'visibility' => 'prv'
]);
```

## Documentation

Visit the [Project site](https://christianezeani.github.io/mailchimp/). If you're having trouble, this should be the first place you look as it's the most frequently updated.

Examples of how to use MailChimp PHP Wrapper for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://christianezeani.github.io/mailchimp/examples/) page.

A Complete generated API documentation is [available online](https://christianezeani.github.io/mailchimp/api/).

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `composer docs` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs/api` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org/) installed. You may find the unit tests a good source of how to do various operations such as creating audience, subscribing and unsubscribing members, and many more.
